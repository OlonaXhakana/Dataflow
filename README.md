Dataflow Pipeline for BigQuery Ingestion:
This repository contains code and configuration files for a Dataflow pipeline that ingests data into Google BigQuery from Cloud Storage. The pipeline processes input data, handles schema mapping, and writes the results into a specified BigQuery table.
The Dataflow pipeline automates the process of reading data from Cloud Storage, transforming it if necessary, and loading it into BigQuery. This solution is designed to handle batch processing of data stored in text formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) and facilitate seamless integration with BigQuery for further analytics.
